# Learning Story 1.1: Employee Registration

Welcome! Imagine you are a child learning how to build a computer program for the first time. I will explain everything in very easy words, step by step, just like a teacher helping a beginner.

## What is Employee Registration?
Employee registration means making a page where a new worker can sign up for your company system. They need to enter their email and a strong password, so they can use the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software.

## What do we need to build?
1. **A form**: This is like a small box on the screen where you type your email and password.
2. **Three fields**: One for email, one for password, and one to confirm the password (to make sure you typed it right).
3. **Checking the password**: The password should be strong (at least 8 letters and have a number).
4. **Error messages**: If you make a mistake, the computer should tell you what is wrong (like "Password is too short" or "Passwords do not match").
5. **Success message**: If everything is correct, you should see a happy message like "Account created successfully!"

## Why do we do this?
- To keep the system safe and make sure only real employees can use it.
- To help users know if they made a mistake while signing up.

## How does the code work?
- The form checks every field when you type.
- If you type a weak password, it shows a warning.
- If you type different passwords, it shows an error.
- When everything is correct, it shows a success message.

## What did we learn?
- How to make a simple registration form in React (a tool for building websites).
- How to check if the password is strong.
- How to show messages for mistakes and success.
