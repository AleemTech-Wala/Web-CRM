# Learning: Project Folder Structure

Let’s learn what a folder structure is! Imagine your computer is like a big cupboard, and you want to keep your things neat and easy to find.

## What is a folder structure?
A folder structure is a way to organize your project files into different boxes (folders), so you can find everything easily.

## CRM Project Folders Explained

### 1. frontend/
This folder is for all the code that makes your website look and work for users. It uses React, which helps you build beautiful and interactive web pages. Whenever you want to change how your app looks, you work here.

### 2. backend/
This folder is for the server code. The server is like a smart helper that talks to the database, checks passwords, and sends information to the frontend. We use ASP.NET Core here, which is a tool for building strong and safe servers.

### 3. database/
This folder is for files that help you manage your database. The database is like a big notebook where all your user and company information is saved. You keep scripts, backups, or setup files here.

### 4. docs/
This folder is for documentation. Documentation means important notes, user stories, and guides that explain what your project does and how it works. If you ever forget something, you can read these files to remember.

### 5. learning_material/
This folder is for your learning notes. Every time you learn something new, or need a simple explanation, you write it here. It’s like your personal study guide for the project.
