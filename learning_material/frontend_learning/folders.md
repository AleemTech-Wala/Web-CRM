# Learning: Folders in Frontend

Let’s learn what each folder in your frontend project does!

## 1. src/
This is the most important folder. It has all your main code files for the website. When you want to change how your app works or looks, you edit files here.

## 2. public/
This folder has files that everyone can see, like images and the main HTML file. The browser uses these files to show your website.

## 3. node_modules/
This folder is HUGE! It has all the code for the tools and libraries you installed. You never need to edit anything here—just let npm manage it.

## 4. .git/
This folder is for Git, which helps you keep track of changes in your code. You don’t need to touch this folder; it works in the background.
