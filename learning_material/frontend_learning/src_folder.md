# Learning: src Folder in Frontend

The `src` folder is where you write all the code for your website. Let’s see what you might find inside:

- **components/**: This is where you put small pieces of your website, like buttons, forms, or menus. Each piece is called a component.
- **App.js**: This is the main file that brings everything together. It’s like the boss of your website.
- **index.js**: This file starts your app and connects it to the browser.

Whenever you want to add something new to your website, you usually make a new file in `src/components/` or update `App.js`.
