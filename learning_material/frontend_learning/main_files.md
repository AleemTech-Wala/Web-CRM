# Learning: Main Files in Frontend

Let’s learn about the most important files and folders in your frontend project!

## 1. package.json
This file is like a shopping list for your project. It tells your computer which tools and libraries your app needs to work. It also has your project’s name and version.

## 2. package-lock.json
This file keeps track of the exact versions of every tool and library you installed. It helps make sure your app works the same way on every computer.

## 3. README.md
This is a note for anyone who opens your project. It explains what your project is, how to run it, and anything important you want to share.

## 4. .gitignore
This file tells Git (the version control system) which files and folders to ignore. For example, it skips files that are too big or not needed for sharing.
