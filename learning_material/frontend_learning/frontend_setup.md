# Learning: How to Run the Frontend

Let’s learn how to start your website (frontend) so you can see your work!

## What is the frontend?
The frontend is the part of your project that users see and use. It’s like the face of your app.

## How do you run it?
1. Open your terminal (the black box where you type commands).
2. Go to the frontend folder:
   ```powershell
   cd frontend
   ```
3. Start the frontend server:
   ```powershell
   npm start
   ```
4. Wait a few seconds. Your website will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000

## Why do we do this?
- So you can see your website and test your code.
- To make sure everything is working before you share it with others.
